## Overview
A recent analysis of student reading and math scores in the Local Government Area has revealed some key factors influencing the success of our students.

Our school network includes 39,170 students across 15 schools including both Government and Independent run organisations, supported by a budget of $24mil. 

Looking at the passing rate in reading and math, we have 72% of students achieving a passing score in both. This number varies greatly when reviewing the results in isolation.

## Results
Comparing schools by overall passing rate, our top performer, Griffin High School (81%), saw a 12% higher rate of passing over our worst performing school, Hernandez High School (69%). Exploring these results further we've uncovered some trends which, if implemented in our disrict, would set the foundations for great improvements into the future.

The five lowest performing schools have a combined 17,335 students enrolled, with a budget of $11mil. Compare this to our five best peforming school with 14,101 students and a budget of $8mil. On the surface one would expect a group of schools receiving a third less funding to see increased strain on resources leading to a reduction in students meeting passing grade. Investigating further has revealed that we're spending $32 more per student, $618 vs $640, at our higher performing schools. Although one would expect to find a correlation across the board between budget per student nad student success, the data suggest an alternative limiting factor for student success. 

Factoring in the complete dataset, we'd expect to see schools in the $585-630 spending bracket perform better than those in the $630-645 bracket. This suggests that there is a greater influence on the success of students than the allocated budget per student.

Drilling down on the information further by student population we can see that school of 1000 or fewer students saw their passing rates and combined reading and math scores perform better than schools up to and greater than 2000 population size. Schools in the smaller student population bracket experience a student passing rate of 79%, 7% higher than the population average, and 9% higher than school in the largest population bracket.
